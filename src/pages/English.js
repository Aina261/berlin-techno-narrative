            <p>Berlin Techno Narrative is a long-standing project born out of a passion for electronic music and the city of Berlin.</p>
            <p>For many years, as a fan of electronic music, I researched thoroughly in order to know as much as possible about this music born in Detroit and Chicago on the one hand, and in Belgium and England on the other...</p>
            <p>These different movements arrived in 1988 in Berlin where it evolved and became a music of a whole generation and there the music corresponds to a page of history: the fall of the wall.</p>
            <p>Like a city where everything had to be rebuilt and rebuilt, this movement took advantage of the spaces left free by the disappearance of the no-mans-land and the free houses and buildings left vacant by the inhabitants and administrations of the East. </p>
            <p>From the Love Parade to the UFO, from the Tresor to the Berghain, this visit will allow you to approach a page of History which forever changed the face of Berlin.</p>
            <p>This visit lasts 3 hours and allows you to know the location of the places coupled with the History of Techno while also passing by most of the great monuments of the city.</p>
